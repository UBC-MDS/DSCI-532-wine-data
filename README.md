### Overview

The dataset we are using is from Kaggle and it covers 150k wine reviews along with some attributes of the wine. The aim of the project is to give an overview of worldwide wine clues, for example, the relation between price and quality(points), the countries where the wines are made or perform an analysis of the most used words to describe wines.

### Description of the data

The wine data which we will be using has 120k unique wine ratings from different wine tasters across 16k unique wineries. The data also has important information regarding the wine such as price, the location where it was grown, in addition to the points given to it by different tasters. Other relevant information includes the type of wine being rated and the twitter handle of the wine taster if in case someone wants to reach out to the source of the rating. In addition to this, we will be calculating a score for each wine on the basis of points it has received from different tasters.

### Usage scenario and tasks

John is the kind of person who drank wine all his life and he knew that it came from grapes but didn’t really know much more than that. He has a vague idea of what type of wine he likes but has no idea about the difference between a Chardonnay and a Chenin Blanc. At the liquor store, he usually buys a $10-$12 bottle with a fun label that he knows won’t disappoint and won’t break the bank.

So, needless to say, he was looking forward to educating himself a little. This app is built for people like John who could use a helping hand while choosing wine. It will allow people to navigate through and choose the area where they are present, the price, type and notes to find the best wine that will satisfy their taste buds.


### Description of your app

We plan to use the shiny dashboard library for a dashboard look of our app. The main dashboard view will have the word cloud and the line graph of ratings of different wines. It will also feature a world map showing the different places of which we have the wine data. The filters will include the price and variety of the wine for now. We will see if including more/different filters for our data makes sense. The app will have three tabs. The `main tab` will feature the dashboard, the second `Data` tab will have the data table of the different wines from across the world and the `About` tab will be an informational tab from where the wine enthusiasts will get information on how to use the shiny app. The `data` tab will also have a `download` and an `upload` button to use new data or to download the data which the user has filtered in the dashboard.
